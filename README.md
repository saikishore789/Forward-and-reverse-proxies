# Forward-and-reverse-proxies
A **proxy server** acts as an intermediary between a client (like your browser) and another server (like a website). There are two main types of proxies: **forward proxy** and **reverse proxy**. Here's a detailed explanation of both:

---

## üîÅ **Forward Proxy**

### üìå **Definition:**
A **forward proxy** sits between a client and the internet. It forwards client requests to the destination server and then returns the server's response back to the client.

### üß≠ **How It Works:**
1. A client (e.g., a user's browser) sends a request to the forward proxy.
2. The proxy evaluates the request and forwards it to the target server.
3. The server responds to the proxy.
4. The proxy sends the response back to the client.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Use Cases:**
- **Privacy & Anonymity:** Hides the client's IP address from the destination server.
- **Access Control:** Blocks access to certain websites or content.
- **Caching:** Stores frequently accessed content to reduce bandwidth and improve speed.
- **Content Filtering:** Used in schools or workplaces to restrict access to inappropriate content.

### üìä **Example:**
A company uses a forward proxy to allow employees to access the internet. The proxy filters traffic, blocks social media sites, and logs browsing activity.

## üîÑ **Reverse Proxy**

### üìå **Definition:**
A **reverse proxy** sits in front of one or more web servers and handles incoming requests from clients on behalf of those servers.

### üß≠ **How It Works:**
1. A client sends a request to a website.
2. The reverse proxy receives the request.
3. It forwards the request to the appropriate backend server.
4. The server processes the request and sends the response to the reverse proxy.
5. The reverse proxy sends the response back to the client.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Use Cases:**
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
- **SSL Termination:** Handles encryption/decryption to reduce load on backend servers.
- **Caching:** Stores static content to improve performance.
- **Security:** Hides the identity and structure of backend servers, protecting them from direct attacks.

### üìä **Example:**
A large e-commerce site uses a reverse proxy to distribute traffic across multiple servers, ensuring high availability and performance.

## üîç **Key Differences**

| Feature              | Forward Proxy                          | Reverse Proxy                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Client Location**  | Used by the client                     | Used by the server                     |
| **Purpose**          | Controls and filters outbound traffic  | Manages and optimizes inbound traffic  |
| **IP Masking**       | Hides client IP from server            | Hides server IP from client            |
| **Common Users**     | Individuals, organizations             | Web services, hosting providers        |

Here‚Äôs a **diagram comparing Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy with risk points**:

---

### **Forward Proxy**
- **Position:** Between client and the internet.
- **Risks:**
  - **Data Interception:** If compromised, attackers can capture sensitive client data.
  - **Malware Injection:** Malicious proxies can alter responses.
  - **Privacy Breach:** Logs can expose user activity.

---

### **Reverse Proxy**
- **Position:** Between internet and backend servers.
- **Risks:**
  - **Server Exposure:** Misconfiguration can reveal internal services.
  - **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers manipulate cached content.
  - **DDoS Amplification:** Proxy can be overwhelmed by traffic floods.

Here are **real-world examples of proxy attacks** and **best practices for securing proxies**:

---

### ‚úÖ **Real-World Proxy Attack Examples**
1. **Squid Proxy Exploits (2019)**  
   - Squid, a popular forward proxy, had vulnerabilities allowing remote attackers to crash the service or execute arbitrary code.
   - Attackers exploited improper input validation in HTTP headers.

2. **Reverse Proxy Misconfiguration (AWS CloudFront Incident)**  
   - Misconfigured reverse proxies exposed internal admin panels to the internet.
   - Attackers used this to gain unauthorized access to backend systems.

3. **Proxy-Based Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**  
   - Malicious forward proxies intercepted HTTPS traffic by installing fake SSL certificates.
   - Used for credential theft and injecting malware into responses.

4. **Nginx Reverse Proxy Cache Poisoning**  
   - Attackers manipulated cache keys to serve malicious content to other users.
   - Exploited weak cache handling in reverse proxy setups.

5. **Open Proxy Abuse**  
   - Publicly accessible forward proxies were used for spam campaigns and botnets.
   - Attackers leveraged these proxies to hide their origin and bypass IP-based restrictions.

### ‚úÖ **Best Practices for Proxy Security**
- **Enable TLS/SSL Everywhere**  
  Encrypt traffic between clients, proxies, and backend servers to prevent MITM attacks.

- **Restrict Access**  
  - Use authentication for forward proxies.
  - Limit reverse proxy access to trusted IP ranges.

- **Regular Patching & Updates**  
  Keep proxy software (e.g., Squid, Nginx, HAProxy) up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.

- **Disable Open Proxy Features**  
  Never allow unauthenticated public access to forward proxies.

- **Implement Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**  
  Protect reverse proxies from traffic floods.

- **Validate Input & Sanitize Headers**  
  Prevent header injection and cache poisoning attacks.

- **Use Web Application Firewall (WAF)**  
  Deploy WAF behind reverse proxies for additional security.

- **Monitor & Log Traffic**  
  Enable detailed logging and anomaly detection for suspicious patterns.
